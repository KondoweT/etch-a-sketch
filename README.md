# etch-a-sketch

## Introduction
building an etch-a-sketch web sketching game that responds to the movement of the mouse

## Synopsis
Browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.
As one moves the mouse over the sketch pad they create a pixelated path on the pad.

One can choose between monochrome which makes modules black or rainbow which sets a random background color.
